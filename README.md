# ASICs as an open platform

NB:  This story comes from my involvement in a number of Telegram chats with people working to pry open hardware platforms that have been intentionally closed by their makers.  It should absolutely be understood as advocating for a certain point of view with regard to how software should work on ASIC mining platforms.  That is my express intent, and the intent of the people I've been working with on this.
